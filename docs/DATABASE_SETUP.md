# Database setup — PostgreSQL / Supabase + Prisma

Backend runtime remains **Spring Boot + Spring Data JPA**. Prisma is used for
**schema definition, migration and seed management**.

## Sources of truth

The database is not designed from FE alone.

The current schema is built from two sources, in this order:

1. The approved project ERD/database design.
2. The current `main` branch of `Santadura/FE-QLDAPM-clone`, used to refine
   the ERD where implemented business rules are now more specific.

The original ERD remains the structural foundation, including:

- Roles / Functions / Permissions
- Users / Employees / Certificates
- Courses / Classes / Lessons
- Availabilities
- TeachingSchedules / StaffSchedules
- Students / ClassStudents
- Assignments / Exams / StudentResults
- SalaryRanks / EmployeeSalaries / EmployeeSalaryDetail / StaffSalaries
- AuditLogs

## FE-main refinements

The current FE implementation adds business detail that the original ERD did
not model fully. The database therefore extends the ERD with:

### Student targets

The old `Students.rl_target` and `Students.sw_target` columns are kept for
compatibility with the original design, but the current FE supports targets per
course and target type. The normalized table `student_targets` is the active
model for this workflow.

Examples:

- TOEIC: `LR_TOTAL`, `SW_TOTAL`
- IELTS: `OVERALL_BAND`
- SAT: `TOTAL`
- TOEFL iBT: `OVERALL_1_6`

### Class target requirements

`class_target_requirements` stores the minimum target required by each class.
This supports FE eligibility checks before a student is added to a class.

### Class access scope

`class_access_scopes` represents the FE rule that Admin can manage all
classes while CS only manages assigned classes.

### Class-student history

`class_students` keeps a single historical membership and adds
`inactive_reason` / `inactivated_at` instead of deleting the relationship.

### Availability

The original ERD's availability table is retained and extended with fields
needed by FE main for recurring/weekly availability:

- `day_of_week`
- `availability_type`
- `campus`
- review metadata

### Activity/result rules

Database constraints support:

- Class lifecycle: `DRAFT -> READY -> RUNNING -> COMPLETED -> CLOSED`
- Student statuses: `Active`, `On Leave`, `Graduated`
- Assignment statuses: `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, `CANCELLED`
- Exam statuses: `SCHEDULED`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`
- A StudentResult references exactly one Assignment or Exam.
- One student has at most one result for the same Assignment or Exam.
- Schedule end time must be after start time.
- Class end date must be on or after start date.

Cross-table workflow rules such as target eligibility, teacher assignment before
grading, or pending teaching activities before class completion are enforced by
the application service layer in addition to database constraints.

## Local PostgreSQL

Requirements:

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.9+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
npm install
npm run prisma:generate
npm run db:migrate:deploy
npm run db:seed
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Spring Boot reads the root `.env` file.

## Supabase

Fill the project-specific values in local `.env`:

```properties
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://<supabase-host>:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
DB_USERNAME=<database-user>
DB_PASSWORD=<database-password>

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<pooler-user>:<password>@<pooler-host>:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://<direct-user>:<password>@<direct-host>:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
```

Then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run prisma:generate
npm run db:migrate:deploy
npm run db:seed
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Never commit real Supabase credentials.

## Migration ownership

Prisma migrations own the physical database schema. Hibernate is configured
with `ddl-auto: validate`, so Spring Boot validates mappings instead of
silently changing tables.

When the Prisma schema changes:

```bash
npm run db:migrate -- --name <migration_name>
```

Commit both `schema.prisma` and the generated migration.

## Development account

Seed data creates:

```text
username: admin
password: 123456
```

Development only; remove or change it before deployment.
